# Motivation
Dementia is a condition associated with impairments of memory, communication and cognition abilities. It is caused as a result of damage to brain cells. Current statistics predict that at least one in three seniors will die as a result of Alzheimer’s disease or some other form of dementia. Memory loss, communication problems, mood swings and difficulty completing familiar tasks are usual symptoms. As dementia is caused by brain cell death, there is no cure for degenerative dementia. However, there are treatments to alleviate and improve the symptoms associated with the condition. The physicians have to rely on the caretakers or the patients to understand and assess the patient’s condition as there is no current method to obtain the information at the time of the episode. Our programs aims to bridge the gap between the doctor patient interaction by obtaining quantitative data from the patient through a series of games and questions.
